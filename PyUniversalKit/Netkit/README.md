Netkit is designed to facilitate web developers to test ports, based on the requests library.
It integrates most of the methods of the requests library. The advantage is that it can be implemented with less code
data analysis, data mining, crawling and other testing. It is positioned as an integrated surface library, and does not perform underlying development or refactoring of third-party libraries.

The current version is 1.1.0 Beta, which has fewer features, and will be adapted to most of the requests library methods in the next version.
